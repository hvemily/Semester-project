# Community Science Museum - Semester Project 1

Welcome to the **Community Science Museum** website, built as part of my Semester Project 1 for Frontend Development. This project simulates a real-world client brief from a web agency. The task is to create a modern, accessible, and responsive website for an interactive science museum, targeting children (ages 7-15) and families with young children.

## Project Description

The **Community Science Museum** is a soon-to-open interactive museum aimed at educating and engaging young minds. The museum's core target audience includes primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. The website is designed to be visually appealing and informative while maintaining accessibility and responsiveness across various devices.

The core purpose of the site is to provide essential information about the museum, its exhibits, and how visitors can contribute or reach out. The design language aims to excite the younger audience while avoiding overly childish themes.
